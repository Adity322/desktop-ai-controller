desktop AI system for voice &amp; keyboard-based automation with modular command execution
# Desktop AI Controller 🤖💻

**Desktop AI Controller** is an offline, modular AI system designed to control desktop operations using **voice commands and keyboard input**.  
It focuses on system automation, clean backend architecture, and real-world usability.

This project is inspired by the idea of intelligent assistants, but is built **from scratch** with an emphasis on **engineering, modularity, and extensibility**.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The system listens for a wake word
2. Accepts input via **voice or keyboard**
3. Processes the command
4. Executes mapped desktop actions
5. Responds with confirmation or feedback
